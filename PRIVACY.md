# Privacy Policy for IPFS Public Network Monitoring

We are a team of researchers working at Inatysco (https://inatysco.fr).
We are characterising the IPFS Public Network, and we are trying to evaluate the distribution of requests among the days, the number of nodes, and the mimetype of file exchanged.
To that end, we set up a public node that saves the requests that are broadcasted or routed inside the network.

## What pieces of data are you collecting?
As part of our work, we are passively collecting DHT requests on the IPFS network.
These requests contain:

 - the node identifier that sent the request in the network
 - the file identifier that the node is looking for

In addition to these pieces of data, we are sending requests to determine:
 - the IP address corresponding to the node identifier and especially its associated country
 - the mimetype of the file identifier


## Who are you sharing this data with?
Before any study, the collected pieces of data have been anonymised and the following pieces of information have been replaced with random strings before making the database available:
 - the node idenfiers
 - the file identifiers
 - the IP addresses

If you have any question you can contact us using the following email address: rgpd@inatysco.fr


## What are my rights?
You have the right to be informed about the data we collect about you. If you have the right by law, you can correct, delete or limit the data we collect about you.
